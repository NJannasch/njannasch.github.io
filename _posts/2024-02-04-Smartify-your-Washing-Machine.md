## Transform Your Washing Machine into a Smart Appliance with Home Assistant
In the quest for a smarter home, I've recently embarked on an exciting journey with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), integrating it into my Raspberry Pi using Home Assistant OS (flashed via [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)). This powerful setup has become the control center for my IoT devices, including my TV, music amplifier, and Philips Hue lights. But there was one everyday challenge I faced: forgetting the laundry in the washing machine in the basement. Determined to find a solution, I ventured into smartifying my washing machine.

### The Smart Power Socket Revelation

Enter the ingenious smart power socket. This device is not just a regular socket; it measures power consumption (Watt), voltage (V), and current (A). By installing a custom firmware named [Tasmota](https://www.tasmota.info/), these sockets were transformed into intelligent devices, seamlessly integrating into my smart home ecosystem. They connect to my WiFi and relay their status via [MQTT](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/).

### Decoding the Washing Machine's State

The key to monitoring my washing machine lies in its power consumption pattern. Once operational, the machine's power usage is transmitted to Home Assistant, providing real-time data.

### The Smart Automation Touch

Having this data in Home Assistant was a great start, but I wanted to push the boundaries of 'smart'. I set up an automation rule: whenever the washing machine's power consumption drops below 5 Watts for 3 minutes, it triggers a notification.

### Wrapping Up: A Smarter Home, One Appliance at a Time

This project highlights the incredible potential of Open Source Software and basic electrical engineering know-how in transforming even the most traditional appliances into smart devices. Now, I can say goodbye to the days of forgotten wet clothes, all thanks to a bit of ingenuity and technology.
